SuperTrace
==========

SuperTrace is a debugger for Nas-sys 1 or Nas-sys 3 with dynamic breakpoints.
The breakpoint is described by a test condition in Zilog Assembler
statements combined with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). The debugger 
uses the single step hardware of the Nascom, which generates a NMI on each
M1 cycle of the Z80. Debugging through LDIR for example generates so
many breakpoints as the BC register holds.
