================

Nascom disassembler package for the Nas-sys 1 and Nas-sys 3 monitors.
The NIP disassembler is designed to work with the NAP assembler.
All of the original documentation is lost. Here is what we know about NIP:

Q		Quit to NASSYS
W		Goto NAP (Assembler) RAM or ROM Version
T from to	Tabulate Memory
O from to	Offset
A from to lines define a DB area
                0 = don't stop, or stop afer xx lines
S from to	Select symbol memory for label generation
L+		Turn label generation on
L-		Turn label generation off (default)
C+		Turn comment generation on
C-		Turn comment generation off (default)
H+		Turn hex mode on (default)
H-		Turn hex mode off 
R+		Generate relative jump/call addresses
R-		Generate absolute jump/call addresses (default)
U+		set user mode on for printing
U-		set user mode off (default)
D from to lines	Disassemble program
J from to 	Disassemble program and hold on jump, ret
X
E
B from to	define Buffer from to for generated NAP File
N from to	generate NAP file in buffer
= byte1 byte2 byte3 Disassemble one Z80 opcode

sample session
EC400			; start disassembler
S8000 BFFF		; define symbol memory
L+			; turn label generation on
B2000 7FFF		; define buffer for NAP
N1000 2000		; disassemble 1000..2000
W			; goto NAP

or 
EC400			; start disassembler
D1000 2000 8		; disassemble 1000..2000 with stops after 8 lines
