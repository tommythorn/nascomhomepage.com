Zeap (Z80 Editor Assembler Package)
===================================

ZEAP 2.1 is an integrated editor assembler package for NAS-SYS 1 and
NAS-SYS 3. The ROM Version is located at D000 .. DFFF. 
All of the original documentation is lost, but here is what we know about:

cold start:
-----------
   ED000 end_of_source_buffer start_of_source_buffer
                                  default 2000
e.g.
   ED000 9000 2000 		; Start ZEAP with buffer from 2000 to 9000
   				  
warm start:
-----------
   ED003
   
A <startline> <endline>		Assemble
:				Start NASSYS command
N 				Return to NAS-SYS
W
R <start> <increment>           Renumber source code Lines
V <startline> <endline>		View source code
Y
Z <line>			Edit line
H <count>			Halt listing at <count> lines
U <startline> <endline>		Write source code to cassette
				alternative: use NAS-SYS W Command
				e.g. W 2000 20B7 where 20B7 is Zeap EOF (FREE)
P
K <delay>			Set delay after each line for reading from
                                cassette
O <optionbyte>			Set assembler options:
		O 1		Bit 0 = 1 no source listing
		O 2		Bit 1 = 2 write code to memory
		O 4		Bit 2 = 4 print output to serial printer
		O 8		Bit 3 = 8 write assembled program to cassette
				          in format "LOAD"
		O 10		Bit 4 = 10
		O 20		Bit 5 = 20
		O 40		Bit 6 = 40
		O 80		Bit 7 = 80 write symbol table
I <startline> <increment>	Insert line from <startline> with <increment>
				shift CR (ESC) ends editing.

Zeap Pseudo Ops:
================
ORG 	Origin
ENT 	Entry Point of Program
DEFB	define byte(s) e.g. DEFB 10, #10, "1
        "1 is equivalent to "1"
DEFS    define storage e.g. DEFS 10
DEFM    define message e.g. 'HELLO WORLD'
SKIP

Operators:  +   -

Hex: #00

An Label is only valid with an instruction:
e.g. 
START: LD HL,1

Example:
 ORG #0C80
START ENT
 SCAL #5B
 
 
assemble into memory: 
O 2			; set option bit 1 
A			; assemble
:			; call NAS-SYS 
EC80			; Execute assembled program at 0C80
