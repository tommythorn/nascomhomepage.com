Instructions for Super Startrek
===============================

1. When you see 'Command ?' printed  enter one of the legal
   commands (NAV, SRS, LRS, PHA, TOR, SHE, DAM, COM or XXX).
2. If you should type in an illegal command, you'll get a short list of the
   legal commands printed out.
3. Some commands require you to; enter data (e.g., The 'NAV' command comes
   back with 'Course (1-9) ?'.)

If you type in illegal data (like negative numbers), that command will be
aborted.

The galaxy is divided into an 8 x 8 quadrant grid, and each quadrant is
further divided into an 8 x 8 sector grid.

You will be assigned a starting point somewhere in the galaxy to begin a tour
of duty as commander of the starship 'Enterprise'; Your mission: To seek and
destroy the fleet of Klingon warships which are menacing the United Federation
of Planets. You have the following commands available to you as Captain
of the starship Enterprise:

'NAV' Command=Warp engine control

Course is a circular numerical vector arrangement as shown:

          4  3  2
           . . .
            ...
        5 ---*--- 1
            ...
           . . .
          6  7  8

Integer and real values may be used. (Thus course 1.5 is halfway
between 1 and 2).
Values for course may approach 9.0 which itself is equivalent to 1.0
One Warp Factor is the size of one quadrant. Therefore, to get from quadrant
6,5 to 5,5 , you would use Course 3, Warp Factor 1.

Command Detail
==============

'SRS' Command=Short Range Sensor Scan:
        Shows you a scan of your present quadrant.
        Symbology on your sensor screen is as follows:
                -0-=Your starship's position
                >!<=Klingon Battle Cruiser
                <0>=Federation Starbase (Refuel/Repair/Re-arm here!)
                * =Star
        A condensed status report will also be presented.

'LRS' Command=Long Range Sensor Scan:
        Shows conditions in space for one quadrant on each side of the Enterprise
        (which is in the middle of the scan). The scan is coded in the form
        '0 0 0', where the units digit is the number of stars, the tens digit is
        the number of starbases and the hundreds digit is the number of Klingons.
        e.g. 2 0 7=2 Klingons, no starbases and 7 stars.

'PHA' Command=Phaser Control:
        Allows you to destroy the Klingon Battle Cruisers by zapping them with
        suitably large units of energy to deplete their shield power.
        (Remember Klingons have phasers too!)

'TOR' Command=Photon Torpedo Control Torpedo course is the same as used in
        warp engine control. If you hit the Klingon vessel, he is destroyed and
        cannot fire back at you.
        If you miss, you are subject to his phaser fire. In either case, you are
        also subject to phaser fire of all other Klingons in the quadrant.
        The Library-Computer ('COM' command) has an option to compute torpedo
        trajectory for you. (Option 2)

'SHE' Command=Shield Control:
        Defines the number of energy units to be assigned to the shields. Energy
        is taken from the total ship's energy. NOTE. On the status display, total
        energy includes shield energy.

'DAM' Command=Damage Control Report:
        Gives the state of repair of all devices. A negative 'State of Repair'
        shows that the device is temporarily damaged.

'COM' Command=Library-Computer:
        The Library-computer contains six options:

                0=Cumulative galactic record:
                  This option shows computer memory of the results of all previous
                  Short and Long Range Sensor Scans.

                1=Status Report:
                  This option shows the number of Klingons, stardates and starbases remaining in the game.

                2=Photon torpedo data:
                  Gives directions and distance from the Enterprise to all Klingons in your quadrant.

                3=Starbase Nav Data:
                  This option gives you direction and distance to any starbase within your quadrant.

                4=Direction/distance calculator:
                  Allows you to enter coordinates for direction/distance calculations.

                5=Galactic/Region name/ Map:
                  Prints the names of the 16 major galactic regions referred to in the game.
