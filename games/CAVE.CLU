Listed below are most of the things, interesting locations and main puzzles
in Colossal Adventure. Look down the list to locate what you want to know
about and then turn to the entries indicated by the bracketed numbers to

Warnings

Try to only read the clue entries that you are actually directed to.
Otherwise you may acidentally [sic] see solutions to problems that you've
not yet reached in the game. A few red herrings have been mixed in with the
real clues to reduce the risk of this - you won't be referred to them if you
use this clue sheet properly, but reading random entries can be misleading!
