GENERAL NOTES:
The Dwarf - the first time you meet him, he throws an axe at you, which
you in return can pick up and throw at him. If you move outside the central
dungeon system, he will give up the pursuit. Now, if you play the Jewels
of Darkness version, which gives you points for not saving your game (ABSURD!!),
I suggest you use OOPS whenever you meet this guy to avoid him completely,
so you won't waste moves on picking up the axe.


The pirate/Same Maze - At some point he will steal all the treasures you
are carrying. Note that you _cannot_ find the chest if you have not been
robbed. If you are almost at the end of pt.1, wait for him in the Western
Halls of Mists, lights extinguished (to save power! When he has stolen the
goods, go (from Western H.o.M.): S, E, S, S, U, W, E, S, N, E, N, E, NW,
GET CHEST + the stolen treasure(s), SE, W, S, D (to Splendid Chamber)


Vending Machine - it is in Different Maze. You _can_ drop the coins here
and have your batteries renewed, BUT it seems that it costs you 5 points
(really hot on time pressure, are we, Level 9???). The game can be completed
without this, you just have to run a little faster!
From West End of Long Passage: S, W, E, U, N, DROP COINS, N, U.


  PART II: (You start in a cave) GET KEYS;LAMP;ROD AND DYNAMITE, NE, DROP
DYNAMITE, SW, SAY BLAST (the dynamite goes off and kills many dwarves. A
hole opens in the west wall), W, W, W, U, U, U, U, U, E, D, W, W, S, UNLOCK
ELVES (they happily run off), N, N, UNLOCK ELVES (yet another 100 elves
are free), S, W, WAVE ROD (a bridge appears across the gap), DROP IT, W,
W, W, D, D, D, GET ELIXIR, U, U, U, E, E, E, E, E, N, DROP ELIXIR (the skeletons
turn into living elves!), S, W, W, W, W, W, CLOSE DOOR, D, D, D, GET PENTACLE
(you MUST turn off the lamp now!), OFF LAMP, U, U, U (the water reaches
