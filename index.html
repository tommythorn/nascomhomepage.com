  BLS Pascal 1.3 has been recovered! <p>

  For years we've had various versions of BLS Pascal (Tape version 1.0
  and 1.2 and ROM versions as well as variations).  We knew a
  version 1.3 existed but the only copy on the net was corrupted. <p>

  A few years ago we discovered a
  that <a href="http://datamuseum.dk">Data Museum</a> had a picture of a
  <a href="http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Genstand:11000761">tape</a> with
  it and yesterday they shared a digital
  version: <a href="lang/blspascal13.nas">BLS Pascal 1.3</a>. <p> It's
  not immediately obvious what it changes from 1.2 and sadly we have
  no documentation, but from a quick glance of the binary, it doesn't
  seem like much.  However, the starting address is now 1000 for a
  cold start and 2140 for a warm start. <p>

  A big thank-you to Martin Sørensen, Finn Verner Nielsen, Uffe
  Jakobsen, and Peter Jensen who all contributed to making this
  possible.

  Many thanks to Morten L&oslash;hre and Gareth Pitchford, who both
  pointed out that the previously claimed "Colossal Adventure" was actually
  <i>not</i> the Level 9 version.  Morten further found the actual
  Level 9 which been added below (as Avdentr.NAS).<p>

  Morten:<br>
  <i>
  The file has been kindly provided by Jimmy Maher over at The Digital
  Antiquarian. He wrote an article on the Nascom Colossal Adventure
  from Level 9 (<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2012/10/level-9/">https://www.filfre.net/2012/10/level-9/</a>),
  and I noticed he had screenshots of the game. <p>

  ... <p>

  In particular, I noticed the entry "Colossal Adventure 16K and 32K
  version (Level 9)." and the files therein. I knew very well the Level
  9 Colossal Adventure, but I was not that familiar with Level 9's early
  work on the Nascom. Assuming that the "32K" version was something
  Level 9 did early on, predating the work on other micros, I started to
  disassemble the file to understand how this differed from what I had
  seen on C64, the BBC etc. After hacking together a z80 trace tool I
  managed to re-engineer the text compression routines in C (the text
  compression is based on Huffman variable bit-encoding) and I could
  list the various texts in the game. Only to find the text "Adventure
  32k copyright (c) 1982 Michael J. Evis" (message #200 of the message
  texts). A further look revealed that you can provoke this text in-game
  by entering "AUTH" for Author. <p>

  Just wanted to let you know that you should consider changing the
  text on your page to credit Mr. Evis instead. A qualified guess is
  that the "32K" code is similar to what was released for the ZX
  Spectrum a year later
  (<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005907">worldofspectrum</a>). The
  Spectrum version has earned a place in the
  <a href="http://advent.jenandcal.familyds.org/#EVIS0350">Adventure Family Tree</a>. <p>
  </i>

  Garath:<br>
  <i>
    It is actually a completely different port of the mainframe game,
    produced by Michael J. Evis/Syrtis Software in early 1981;
    pre-dating the Level 9 version by at least a few months.  see, my
    page about the game
    here... <a href="http://8bitag.com/info/syrtis-adventure.html">http://8bitag.com/info/syrtis-adventure.html</a>.

    Syrtis Adventure, as I call it to avoid all the issues with so
    many games with the same name, seems to have been first released
    in 1981 as a 16K game for Nascom, before being produced as an
    expanded version (more accurately aping the mainframe text) in
    1982. Again, extensive references to all these versions are on my
    website. The game was later ported to the Spectrum.

    This matches the information your user extracted from the 32K file.

    It could still be Level 9's initial version of Colossal Adventure.
    I hope it is... as the 16K version of that game does not exist in
    any form, despite being produced for multiple systems.
    See... <a href="http://8bitag.com/info/level-9.html">http://8bitag.com/info/level-9.html</a>.
</i><p>

  Unfortunately, we are still seeking the lost 16K version.<p>

  We have finally updated the reference and attribution.  Note, this
  means we have the following similar, but different programs:
  <ul>
    <li>Two versions of the original adventure by Syrtis Software (Michael J. Evis.)
    <li>Colossal Adventure by Level 9 (32K version)
    <li>Dungeon Adventure by Level 9
    <li>Adventure Quest by Level 9
  </ul><p>

<li>2018-04-02<br>
  Removed many dead links.<p>

  Added a (long-overdue) fantastic contribution from Thorleif Bundgaard:<p>

  "Im searching for an old NASCOM Dungeon like game, where the task is
   to stop a bomb from exploding, but didn't find it. <p>

   I got into contact with a guy 'Anders Hejlsberg' later to be one of
   the founders of BORLAND.  He had made the first real compiler for
   the NASCOM, called 'Blue Label Pascal'.  In 1984 Anders gave me the
   source for <a href="asm/Math48-Floating-Point-Package.zip">the floating
   point routines</a> used in this Pascal.  The special thing about
   this code is that it keeps all its computations on the stack, so
   you dont have to set aside some RAM areas.  And the code is
   completely relocatable. <p>

   I also have a printed description that Anders made (In Danish),
   Most is just CALL descriptions, so I guess that anyone speaking
   English will understand our language well enough, however I also
   did a translation."
</li>

<li>2017-03-05<br>
  From Carl Lloyd-Parker comes a fixed version of <a href="mbasic/nimbot.cas">NimBot</a>: <p>

  <i>
  I found the copy of NimBot on your web, and noticed that it has
  incorrect graphics.  This is very understandable, considering it
  was typed in from a printed magazine. <p>

  And due to Nascom BASIC having a bug with LIST expanding tokens
  within strings, this makes guessing the correct graphic for the
  garbage almost impossible! <p>

  When C&amp;VG asked for permission to publish NimBot, they didn't
  ask for any help with the graphics - they just printed it.  I laughed
  when I saw the copy : ``Have fun typing that in!" <p>

  Recently, I was salvaging data from my ancient Nascom floppy disks,
  which wasn't easy; as my disk controller died about 20 years ago. <p>

  I wrote a disk reader for my Tatung Einstein, and managed to read most
  of the disks.  One of the disks had a NimBot file, but it was corrupt.
  Luckily, the sector with the graphics was intact, so I combined it
  with the copy from your web to recreate the original." <p>

  </i>

  Thank you to Carl for the update and the backstory (I appologies for
  taking two month to convert the NAS to CAS).

  "The story,
  <p>
  A friend of mine (Mick Waters) persuaded me to buy a Nascom 2 (I was
  thinking about a CompuKit UK 101, a close shave!) as he has already
  bought one and said it was much better than the CompuKit. Well while
  I was building mine we purchased this book and spend an entire night
  typing it into his 16K Nascom 2, only to find that it wouldn't run
  as there wasn't enough RAM.
  <p>
  Needless to say we quickly borrowed my 4116 chips from my N2 kit (I
  was quite nervous) to up his 16K to get 32K so we could run the game
  J (at least we were able to save it).
  <p>
  Some years later I upgraded the N2 to a CP/M system, courtesy of a
  Gemini Disk card and merrily converted my favourite game to
  CP/M. But things moved on and I bought more computers but didn't
  stop using my CP/M Nascom 2/Gemini hybrid system until I bought my
  first PC (around 1994).
  <p>
  However thanks to CP/M emulators and vnascom I have been able to
  re-convert this game back into the Nascom 2 MBASIC version. I can't
  guarantee that I haven't made any typos in this version given that
  it has been ported to and from CP/M but it seems to run just fine in
  vnascom. I hope that it is of some interest and include it here." </i>

<a name="Overview"><h1>Overview</h1></a>

Hi and welcome to the Nascom home page.


<p>The Nascom (1 and 2) were computer kits from the UK based Nasco,
later Lucas, around the Z80 processor, sold in the early 1980s. This
remarkable piece of hardware contained:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <i>real</i> keyboard (<a href="pics/NASKBD.JPG">picture
of the keyboard [141 KB]</a>),</li>
<li>a 4 MHz Z80A processor,</li>
<li>1 KB static RAM (extendable to 8 KB, or 16 KB with more work),</li>
<li>2 KB Monitor (NAS-SYS 1),</li>
<li>8 KB Microsoft Basic,</li>
<li>a 48x16 video interface, to attach to a standard TV,</li>
<li>serial in/out, selectable between cassette tape, RS-232, or current loop
20 mA for teletype writers (<a href="pics/NASBACK.JPG">picture
of the I/O connectors [163 KB]</a>).</li>
</ul>
The Nascom computers were very useful for learning about microcomputer hardware and,
through complete documentation, also learning system programming. All electronic
schematics, datasheets of special components and the complete source code
of the monitor were available from the beginning. <p>

The purpose of this page is to gather as many Nascom resources as possible
and to make them available. If you have Nascom resources you would like
to make available, please do not hesitate to send them to
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:nascomhomepage_AT_thorn.ws">Tommy Thorn </a> (change "_AT_" to "@") or</li>
<li><a href="mailto:nascom_AT_nascomhomepage.com">Constantin Olbrich </a>(change "_AT_" to "@")
, and they will find their way to this page.  Don't be shy about
including auxiliary details, such as the story behind the game,
manual, etc.</li>
</ul>
You can support the Nascom Repository with:
<ul>
<li>binary images</li>
<li>original documents OCR'ed or simply scanned</li>
<li>sampled tapes: 22 kHz, 8-bit, mono</li>
</ul>

The Nascom Respository is looking for:
<ul>
<li> A JavaScript Nascom emulator, for use on this site </li>
<li> The "Keys of Kraal" game </li>
<li> OCR'ed versions of the INMC newsletter, 80 Bus Journals or other Nascom magazines.</li>
<li> NAS-DOS 2</li>
<li> NAS-PEN disk version</li>
<li> Mushroom 4K Basic.</li>
<li> ZEAP 2.2 Assembler disk version.</li>
<li> Nas-Net Manual and Software.</li>
<li> Hi-Soft Nasnem Disassembler.</li>
<li> any Nascom software or documents not presented here!</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="VirtualNascom"></a>Virtual Nascom and VNascom</h1>
There are many Nascom emulators available today, but at the genesis of this web site
there was none. Need thus begat Virtual Nascom, a fully portable Nascom emulator
distributed in source form. The primary site is
<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/virtual-nascom.git">the Virtual Nascom git repository</a>. <p>

VNascom is an alternatively emulator written by Constantin for Windows. The latest version is
<a href="emu/vnascom-20080203.zip">Virtual Nascom Version 3.1 for DOS/Win9x/ME</a>.
<br>The current version has bit level correct screen output and complete
keyboard emulation. It run all the programs We've tried, which includes
most games available. New in Version 3.1: CP/M Version 2.2 runs on
standard Nascom screen as well as on the AVC.<p>

<li> Here a gem, courtesy of Paul Wiliams and John Hunt. A couple
of short hardware articles from Wireless World 1977 - 1979, by Mr C. D.
Shelton and NASCO Ltd on microcomputer design. The hardware in these is
identical to Nascom 1, and it arrears that somewhere in the
business/design setup that Mr Shelton had an arrangement to publish the
Nascom 1 design.
<p>  Interesting though that part 4 came out in Feb 1978, as
  this puts part 1 in about Nov 1977 - so it seems the design was being
  published at about the same time that the Nascom 1 was being first produced?
  Open source doesn't seem to be a modern invention then. </p>
<p>
  Paul provided parts 4 &amp; 5 of the series, while John provided the
  remainder and converted Paul's to space saving PNG format.  Thank you both.
