Nascom 2k Tiny Basic

<P>
Nascom adapted Dr Wang's Palo Alto Tiny Basic (Dr Dobb's Journal, May, 1976),
which was originally written for the 8080. These notes are based on Wang's
original explanation of the language, adapted for the Nascom version by DW
(2008).

<P>
<STRONG>THE LANGUAGE</STRONG>

<P>
Numbers

<P>
All numbers are integers and must be less than 32767.

<P>
Variables

<P>
There are 26 variables denoted by letters A through Z.  There is also a
single array @(I).  The dimension of this array is set automatically to make
use of all the memory space that is left unused by the program (i.e., 0
through SIZE/2, see SIZE function below). In this Nascom version, the start
of the @array in memory is immediately after the end of the current program
area).

<P>
Functions

<P>
There are 3 functions:
<PRE>
        ABS(X) gives the absolute value of X.
        RND(X) gives a random number between 1 and X (inclusive).
        SIZE gives the number of bytes left unused by the program.
</PRE>

<P>
Arithmetic and Compare Operators

<PRE>
        /       divide.
        *       multiply.
        -       subtract.
        +       add.
        &gt;       greater than (compare).
        &lt;       less than (compare).
        =       equal to (compare).
        &pound;       not equal to (compare).
        &gt;=      greater than or equal to (compare).
        &lt;=      less than or equal to (compare).
</PRE>

<P>
+, -, *, and / operations result in a value between -32767 and
32767.  (-32768 is also allowed in some cases.)  All compare operators
result in a 1 if true and a 0 if not true.

<P>
Expressions

<P>
Expressions are formed with numbers, variables, and functions with
arithmetic and compare operators between them.  + and - signs can also
be used at the beginning of an expression.  The value of an
expression is evaluated from left to right, except that * and / are
always done first, and then + and - , and then compare operators.
Parentheses can also be used to alter the order of evaluation. Note that compare
operators can be used in any expression. For example:

<P>
10 LET A=(X&gt;Y)*123+(X=Y)*456+(X&gt;Y)*789<BR>
20 IF (U=1)*(V&lt;2)+(U&gt;V)*(U&lt;99)*(V&gt;3) PRINT "YES"
30 LET R=RND(100), A=(R&gt;3)+(R&gt;15)+(R&gt;56)+(R&gt;98)

<P>
In statement 10, A will be set to 123 if X&gt;Y, to 456 if X=Y, and to 789 if X&lt;Y.
In statement 20, the "*" operator acts like a logical AND, and the "+" operator
acts like a logical OR. In statement 30, A will be a random number between 0 and
4 with a prescribed probability distribution of: 3% of being 0, 15-3=12% of
being 1, 56-15=41% of being 2, 98-56=42% of being 3, and 100-98=2% of being 4.

<P>
Direct Commands

<P>
All the commands described later can be used as direct commands except the
following three, they can only be used as direct command and not as part of a
statement:

<P>
<STRONG>RUN</STRONG>

<P>
will start to execute the program starting at the lowest statement number.

<P>
<STRONG>LIST</STRONG>

<P>
will print out all the statements in numerical order.

<P>
<STRONG>LIST 120</STRONG>

<P>
will print out all the statements in numerical order starting at statement 120.

<P>
<STRONG>NEW</STRONG>

<P>
will delete all statements.

<P>
Abbreviation and blanks

<P>
You may use blanks freely, except that numbers, command key words, and
function names cannot have embedded blanks.

<P>
You may truncate all command keywords and function names and follow
them by a period.  "P.", "PR.", "PRI.", and "PRIN." all stand for "PRINT".
Also the word LET in LET command can be omitted.  The "shortest"
abbreviation for all keywords are as follows:
<PRE>
A.=ABS          F.=FOR          GOS.=GOSUB              G.=GOTO
IF=IF           IN.=INPUT       L.=LIST                 N.=NEW
N.=NEXT         P.=PRINT        REM=REMARK              R.=RETURN
R.=RND          R.=RUN          S.=SIZE                 S.=STEP
S.=STOP         TO=TO
</PRE>
<P>
Implied = LET

<P>
Statements

<P>
A statement consists of a statement number of between 1 and
32767 followed by one or more commands.  Commands in the same statement
are separated by a semi-colon ";".  "GOTO", "STOP", and "RETURN" commands must
be the last command in any given statement.

<P>
Commands

<P>
Tiny Basic commands are listed below with examples.  Remember that
commands can be concatenated with semi-colons.  In order to store the
statement, you must also have a statement number in front of the
commands.  The statement number and the concatenation are not shown
in the examples.

<P>
REM or REMARK command

<P>
REM anything goes

<P>
This line will be ignored by TBI.

<P>
LET command

<P>
<STRONG>LET A=234-5*6, A=A/2, X=A-100, @(X+9)=A-1</STRONG>

<P>
will set the variable A to the value of the expression 234-5*6 (i.e., 204), set
the variable A (again) to the value of the expression A/2 (i.e., 102), set the
variable X to the value of the expression A-100 (i.e., 2), and then set the
variable @(11) to 101 (where 11 is the value of the  expression X+9 and 101 is
the value of the expression A-1).

<P>
LET U=A&pound;B, V=(A&gt;B)*X+(A&lt;B)*Y

<P>
will set the variable U to either 1 or 0 depending on whether A is not
equal to or is equal to B; and set the variable V to either X, Y or 0
depending on whether A is greater than, less than, or equal to B.

<P>
PRINT Command

<P>
<STRONG>PRINT</STRONG>

<P>
will cause a carriage-return (CR) and a line-feed (LF) on the output
device.

<P>
<STRONG>PRINT A*3+1, "ABC 123 !@&pound;", ' CBA '</STRONG>

<P>
will print the value of the expression A*3+1 (i.e., 307), the string
of characters "ABC 123 !@&pound;", and the string " CBA ", and then a
CR-LF.  Note that either single or double quotes can be used to quote
strings, but pairs must be matched.

<P>
<STRONG>PRINT A*3+1, "ABC 123 !@&pound;", ' CBA ',</STRONG>

<P>
will produce the same output as before, except that there is no CR-LF
after the last item is printed. This enables the program to continue
printing on the same line with another "PRINT".

<P>
<STRONG>PRINT A, B, &pound;3, C, D, E, &pound;10, F, G</STRONG>

<P>
will print the values of A and B in 8 spaces, the values of C, D, and
E in 3 spaces, and the values of F and G in 10 spaces.  If there are
not enough spaces specified for a given value to be printed, the value
will be printed with enough spaces anyway.

<P>
<STRONG>PRINT $X</STRONG>

<P>
will XOR 40H with the ascii value of X, allowing printing of some graphic
characters etc.

<P>
INPUT Command

<P>
<STRONG>INPUT A, B</STRONG>

<P>
When this command is executed, Tiny Basic will print "A:" and wait to
read in an expression from the input device.  The variable A will be
set to the value of this expression.  Then "B:" is printed and variable
B is set to the value of the next expression read from the input device.
Note that not only numbers, but also expressions can be read as input.

<P>
<STRONG>INPUT 'WHAT IS THE WEIGHT'A, "AND SIZE"B</STRONG>

<P>
This is the same as the command above, except the prompt "A:" is replaced by
"WHAT IS THE WEIGHT:" and the prompt "B:" is replaced by "AND SIZE:".  Again,
both single and double quotes can be used as long as they are matched.

<P>
The $ has the save effect as in "PRINT".

<P>
IF Command

<P>
IF A&lt;B LET X=3; PRINT 'THIS STRING'

<P>
will test the value of the expression A&lt;B.  If it is not zero (i.e., if it is
true), the commands in the rest of this statement will be executed. If the value
of the expression is zero (i.e., if it is not true), the rest of this statement
will be skipped over and execution continues at next statement.  Note that the
word "THEN" is not used.

<P>
GOTO Command

<P>
<STRONG>GOTO 120</STRONG>

<P>
will cause the execution to jump to statement 120.  Note that "GOTO"
command cannot be followed by a semi-colon and other commands.
It must be ended with a CR.

<P>
<STRONG>GOTO A*10+B</STRONG>

<P>
will cause the execution to jump to a different statement number as
computed from the value of the expression.

<P>
GOSUB and RETURN commands

<P>
<STRONG>GOSUB 120</STRONG>

<P>
will cause the execution to jump to statement 120.

<P>
<STRONG>GOSUB A*10+B</STRONG>

<P>
will cause the execution to jump to different statements as computed from the
value of the expression A*10+B.

<P>
<STRONG>RETURN</STRONG>

<P>
A RETURN command must be the last command in a statement and followed
by a CR.  When a RETURN command is encountered, it will cause the execution to
jump back to the command following the most recent GOSUB command.

<P>
GOSUB can be nested. The depth of nesting is limited only by the stack
space.

<P>
FOR and NEXT Commands

<P>
<STRONG>FOR X=A+1 TO 3*B STEP C-1</STRONG>

<P>
The variable X is set to the value of the expression A+1.  The values of the
expressions (not the expressions themselves) 3*B and C-1 are remembered.  The
name of the variable X, the statement number and the position of this command
within the statement are also remembered. Execution then continues the normal
way until a NEXT command is encountered.

<P>
The STEP can be positive, negative or even zero.  The word STEP and the
expression following it can be omitted if the desired STEP is +1.

<P>
<STRONG>NEXT X</STRONG>

<P>
The name of the variable (X) is checked with that of the most recent FOR command.
If they do not agree, that FOR is terminated and the next recent FOR is checked,
etc.  When a match is found, this variable will be set to its current value plus
the value of the STEP expression saved by the FOR command.  The updated value is
then compared with the value of the TO expression also saved by the FOR command.
If this is within the limit, execution will jump back to the command following
the FOR command.  If this is outside the limit, execution continues following
the NEXT command itself.

<P>
FOR can be nested.  The depth of nesting is limited only by the stack
space.  If a new FOR command with the same control variable as that of an old
FOR command is encountered, the old FOR will be terminated automatically.

<P>
STOP Command

<P>
<STRONG>STOP</STRONG>

<P>
This command stops the execution of the program and returns control to
direct commands from the input device.  It can appear many times in a
program but must be the last command in any given statement.  i.e., it
cannot be followed by a semi-colon and other commands.


<P>
EX

<P>
will return you to the Nascom operating system (Nasbug T2 or T4).

<P>
CW

<P>
will write the Tiny Basic program to tape using Nasbug cassette format.

<P>
CR

<P>
will read the Tiny Basic program from tape using Nasbug cassette format.

<P>
MC

<P>
will simply jump execution to a machine language program at 0C50H in the
Nascom(48 bytes are available here for machine code). Additional notes by DW:

<P>
If you want to return from the machine code to the next instruction in your Tiny
Basic program, the first line of machine code at 0C50H must be PUSH DE. Then to
return to Tiny Basic where the Tiny Basic program left off, end the machine code
with POP DE, INC DE, JP F911H. For this, the command "MC" can only be the sole
command or last command on a statement line of Tiny Basic. The stack can be used
for temporary storage, but previous stack contents and the stack pointer must be
preserved on exit from the machine code. To transfer variables A to Z between
machine code and Tiny Basic, the values of these variables in Tiny Basic are
stored as hex values, two bytes each, starting at 0C83H for A, 0C85H for B etc,
up to 0CB5H for Z.<BR>
For example, at 0C50H:
<PRE>
   0C50 D5              PUSH DE
   0C51 21 83 0C        LD HL,0C83H
   0C54 34              INC (HL)
   0C55 D1              POP DE
   0C56 13              INC DE
   0C57 C3 11 F9        JP 0F911H
</PRE>
<P>
And in Tiny Basic:
<P>
   10 A=32000;MC<BR>
<STRONG>20 PRINT A</STRONG><BR>
In this example, the "RUN" command in Tiny Basic will increment the variable "A"
by 1, and so print 32001.

<P>
Stopping the Execution

<P>
the execution of program or listing of program can be stopped by
shift/backspace. Press once to pause (return then continues), or press again to
restart TB.


<P>
Error Report

<P>
there are only three error conditions in TINY BASIC.  The statement with the
error is printed out with a question mark inserted at the point where the error
is detected.

<P>
(1) WHAT? means it does not understand you.  Example:

<P>
<STRONG>WHAT?</STRONG><BR>
210 P?TINT "THIS"        where PRINT is mistyped

<P>
<STRONG>WHAT?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>260 LET A=B+3, C=(3+4?, X=4</STRONG>

<P>
(2) HOW? means it understands you but does not know how to do it.

<P>
<STRONG>HOW?</STRONG><BR>
310 LET A=B*C?+2           where B*C is larger than 32767

<P>
<STRONG>HOW?</STRONG><BR>
380 GOTO 412?              where 412 does not exist

<P>
(3) SORRY? means it understands you and knows how to do it but there
is not enough memory to do it.

<P>
Error Corrections

<P>
If you notice an error in typing before you hit the CR, you can delete
the last character with the backspace key or delete the entire line with
shift/backspace.

<P>
To correct a statement, you can retype the statement number and the
correct commands.  Tiny Basic will replace the old statement with the new one.

<P>
To delete a statement, type the statement number and a CR only.

<P>
Verify the corrections by "LIST nnnn". Pressing shift/backspace will halt
listing.

<P>
Initialisation

<P>
The short initialisation program at 0D50H can be altered according to available
ram.<BR>
(ARG1) : start of memory for text (set TXTBGN and TXTUNF accordingly)
STKLMT  : lower limit of stack<BR>
BSTACK  : upper limit of stack<BR>
(ARG2)  : upper limit of ram<BR>
(ARG3)  : number of lines on screen for LIST
